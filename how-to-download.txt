This is a test file to help you download your project.

How to Download Your Full Project:

1. Look for an "Export" or "Download Code" button in the Firebase Studio interface. It's usually at the top right of the screen.
2. When you click it, your browser should start downloading a .zip file.
3. This .zip file will be saved to your computer's "Downloads" folder, NOT inside this Studio environment.
4. If you cannot find the file in your "Downloads" folder, please check your browser's download history (usually by pressing Ctrl+J or Cmd+Shift+J) to see where the file was saved or if the download failed.

If you can download THIS file by right-clicking on it and selecting "Download", but cannot download the full project, the issue might be with the project export process itself.
